# REST API

## Definition

REST stands for **re**presentational **s**tate **t**ransfer and is a software architecture style that defines a pattern for client and server communications over a network. REST provides a set of constraints for software architecture to promote performance, scalability, simplicity, and reliability in the system.

REST defines the following architectural constraints:
- Stateless: The server wonâ€™t maintain any state between requests from the client.
- Client-server: The client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently.
- Cacheable: The data retrieved from the server should be cacheable either by the client or by the server.
- Uniform interface: The server will provide a uniform interface for accessing resources without defining their representation.
- Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or load balancer.
- Code on demand (optional): The server may transfer code to the client that it can run, such as JavaScript for a single-page application.
Note, REST is not a specification but a set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system.

## HTTP Methods

Main five HTTP methods:
1. GET - retrieve an existing resource
