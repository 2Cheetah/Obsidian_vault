# Binary

In python assignment of a binary value to a variable is done like so:
```python
b = 0b111001
```

# Octal

```python
o = 0o377
```

# Hexadecimal

```python
h = 0xff
```

# Translation between representations

```python
>>> x = 0xff
>>> d = 255
>>> bin(x)
'0b11111111'
>>> hex(d)
'0xff'
>>> oct(d)
'0o377'
```
